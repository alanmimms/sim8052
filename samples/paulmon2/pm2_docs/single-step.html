limitations:<br>
uses int1<br>
can't do other interrupts<br>
needs 24 bytes of stack space<br>
uses 0x7C - 0x7D<br>
<p>

During single step PAULMON2 enables INT1 as low level triggered,
so that it causes interrupts endlessly.  However, the 8051 hardware
is designed so that it will always execute one instruction after
returning from an interrupt before it services the next interrupt.
In this manner, your program is run one step at a time.  The single
step run is not emulation... it is really being run by the hardware,
and the single-step run feature is just an interrupt that shows
you what instructions was executed.
