<a name="autobaud">
After you have built the required
<a href="hardware.html">hardware</a> (including programming
PAULMON2 into the EPROM memory), and installed the
<a href="software.html#terminal">terminal emulation program</a>,
you're ready to begin.
<ol>
<li>Connect the 8051 hardware (power off) to the PC's serial port
<li>Start the terminal emulation program
<li>Verify the program's settings (port, baud, 8-N-1, no flow control)
<li>Apply power to the 8051 hardware
<li>Press Enter (so PAULMON2 can determine the baud rate)
</ol>
<p>
If automatic baud rate detection is configured (the default), PAULMON2
will wait for you to press Enter (Return) after power is applied to
your 8051 board.  It uses this incoming character to determine your
baud rate.  The result is stored in memory so that the baud rate
detection won't need to be repeated unless the memory is erased or
overwritten.  Once it knows the proper baud rate, PAULMON2 will respond
with a message:
<pre>

               Welcome to PAULMON2 (beta4), by Paul Stoffregen

  See PAULMON2.DOC, PAULMON2.EQU and PAULMON2.HDR for more information.
</pre>
If your copy of PAULMON2 has any of the plug-in commands installed,
they will be listed below this initial message, which is followed by
the PAULMON2 prompt:
<pre>
PAULMON2 (beta4) Loc:2000 >
</pre>
The "2000" indicates the value of PAULMON2's memory pointer, which is
used by the various commands which allow you to manipulate the board's
memory.  Pressing '?' will display a brief help message, which lists
all of the available <a href="commands.html">commands</a>.
<p>
It's a good idea to test the RAM memory using the
<a href="extras.html#e">fancy memory editor</a> or the
<a href="commands.html#e">simple editor</a> if a 4k version of
PAULMON2 was selected.  Once
the RAM is writable, try one of the
<a href="examples.html">example programs</a>, and then
you're ready to try writing some of your own code!
