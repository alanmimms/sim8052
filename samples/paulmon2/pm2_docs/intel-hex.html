PAULMON2 exchanges data with a PC computer using Intel-Hex format.
Ordinarily it is not necessary to know much about Intel-Hex, but
in cases where the downloaded data is not written to memory, but
the memory appears to work properly with the memory editor, it can
be helpful to take a look at the data in Intel-Hex format.
<p>

Intel-Hex is an ASCII only format which also includes address
and checksum information for each line.  Here are three lines of
data in Intel-Hex format:

<pre>
:10202E00216E016A0162215D217F218C017F01C336
:10203E0001260116022940022AAD0172022A9A02D5
:10204E0029D00229D6022A1402287D02284302270B
 ^ ^   ^ ^                               ^
 | |   | |                               |
 | |   | |       checksum----------------+
 | |   | +-------data bytes
 | |   +---------record type (00=data, 01=end of file) 
 | +-------------address for this line of data
 +---------------number of bytes of data in this line
</pre>

A common problem is incorrect addresses, usually because of a
missing or incorrect <b>ORG</b> directive in the assembly language
code which was used to produce the Intel-Hex data.  In this example,
the data is to be stored in memory at the following locations:

<pre>
Line #1: 16 bytes  @  0x202E to 0x203D  (8238 to 8253)
Line #2: 16 bytes  @  0x203E to 0x204D  (8254 to 8269)
Line #2: 16 bytes  @  0x204E to 0x205D  (8270 to 8285)
</pre>

Because Intel-Hex is an ASCII only format, it's easy to copy-n-paste
into email messages.  If you have having trouble getting PAULMON2
to understand your Intel-Hex code, and you decide to send a email
asking for help, please include a copy of the Intel-Hex data in
question.
