PAULMON2 is a user-friendly monitor program, intended for use in a
single board computer based on an 8051 compatible microcontroller.
<p>
By placing PAULMON2 in the board's EPROM, the board will "boot-up" to
a menu-driven monitor, which you can control using a standard
<a href="software.html#terminal">terminal emulation program</a>.
PAULMON2 allows you to
<a href="commands.html#d">download</a>
your programs to RAM and
<a href="commands.html#r">run</a>
them, which is much faster and easier than reprogramming the
EPROM.  PAULMON also provides several features to help you debug your
programs.
<p>
PAULMON2 also provides many useful
<a href="functions.html">built-in functions</a> which you may
call from your programs.  Several of these are quite useful for debugging
your code.
<p>
Because PAULMON2 is in the public domain, when your 8051 program
is nearly finished, any portions of PAULMON2 which your
program uses may be copied directly into your code
to make it into a stand-alone application.
