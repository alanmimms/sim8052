<hr>

Programs developed to run with PAULMON2 may begin with a 64 byte
header, which allows PAULMON2 to detect that a program is stored
in memory.  There are currently three types of program headers:
<ul>
<li>Normal Program
<li>Start-Up Program
<li>Command
</ul>

These 64-byte headers must begin on a 256-byte page boundry.


<h3>Normal Programs</h3>

Placing this type of a header on a program makes it appear in the
<a href="commands.html#r">Run Command</a> menu.  For example, the
lines to add at the beginning of the program:
<pre>
.equ    locat, 0x8000           ;Location for this program
.org    locat
.db     0xA5,0xE5,0xE0,0xA5     ;signiture bytes
.db     35,255,0,0              ;id (35=prog)
.db     0,0,0,0                 ;prompt code vector
.db     0,0,0,0                 ;reserved
.db     0,0,0,0                 ;reserved
.db     0,0,0,0                 ;reserved
.db     0,0,0,0                 ;user defined
.db     255,255,255,255         ;length and checksum (255=unused)
.db     "Program Name",0	;max 31 characters, plus the zero
.org    locat+64                ;executable code begins here
</pre>

Admittedly using the <a href="commands.html#r">Run Command</a>
instead of the <a href="commands.html#j">Jump Command</a> isn't
a big advantage.  The most compelling reason to use the normal
program header is because it is later quite easy to change it
into the startup header.

<h3>Start-Up Program</h3>

By changing a byte in the header, a normal program can be turned into
a startup program.  After PAULMON2 has initialized the hardware, and
after the baud rate and serial port are initialized, but before the
welcome message and prompt are printed, PAULMON2 will run all of the
startup programs.
<p>
Startup programs are really only useful when used with nonvolatile
memory.  With <a href="flash.html">Flash ROM</a>, programs may be
written via the Download command, but they will remain in memory.
<p>
Instead of replacing PAULMON2 (at 0000), the final application  program
can be turned into a
startup program by changing a byte in it's header.  If Flash ROM is
used, the board will always startup to the intended program.  The
lines to add to define a startup header should look like this:
<pre>
.equ    locat, 0x8000           ;Location for this program
.org    locat
.db     0xA5,0xE5,0xE0,0xA5     ;signiture bytes
.db     253,255,0,0             ;id (253=startup)
.db     0,0,0,0                 ;prompt code vector
.db     0,0,0,0                 ;reserved
.db     0,0,0,0                 ;reserved
.db     0,0,0,0                 ;reserved
.db     0,0,0,0                 ;user defined
.db     255,255,255,255         ;length and checksum (255=unused)
.db     "Program Name",0        ;max 31 characters, plus the zero
.org    locat+64                ;executable code begins here
</pre>
PAULMON2 has a feature where an <b>erase pin</b> may be defined.  If
this pin is held low after a reset as PAULMON2 starts up, it will
attempt to erase the Flash ROM.  By providing a jumper which pulls
this pin low when installed, the application program (in Flash ROM)
may be deleted and a new version may be downloaded without having
to pull the EPROM, as would be necessary in a system without PAULMON2
and Flash ROM.  The default <b>erase pin</b> is P3.5 (T1, pin 15).
<p>
The startup program header feature is intended work together
with <a href="flash.html">Flash ROM</a>
to provide a quick and
easy way to make the application under development <i>permanent</i>,
without pulling any chips, without having to worry if the program will
correctly initialize the hardware without having run PAULMON2 first,
and with a simple (and well tested) mechanism to erase and download
a new version of the <i>permanent</i> startup program should changes
become necessary.
<p>
It should be noted that startup programs are run <b>after</b> the
baud rate and serial port is configured, so that they may perform
serial I/O.  In most <i>permanent</i> applications, the automatic
baud rate detection (requiring a carriage return after power is
first applied) is not desirable, so it will probably be necessary
to
<a href="customize.html">customize PAULMON2</a> with a fixed baud
rate for use the hardware's
crystal frequency.
<p>
In some cases, it may be desirable to install a startup program
which initializes hardware or performs some startup function but
then allows PAULMON2 to begin normally.  In this case, the startup
program must terminate with a RET instruction to return back to
PAULMON2.  Obviously the stack must point to the return address
which PAULMON2 originally pushed before running the startup program.

<h3>Commands</h3>

Perhaps the most interesting use for program header is to add
additional commands to PAULMON2.  The 
<a href="extras.html#l">List</a>, 
<a href="single-step.html">Single-Step</a>, and
<a href="extras.html#e">Memory Editor</a>
which come with versions of PAULMON2 that fit in 8k are actually
examples of programs with headers that make them appear as
commands within PAULMON2.  A header for a command should look like this:

<pre>
.equ    locat, 0x8000           ;Location for this program
.org    locat
.db     0xA5,0xE5,0xE0,0xA5     ;signiture bytes
.db     254,'A',0,0             ;id (254=command, key='A')
.db     0,0,0,0                 ;prompt code vector
.db     0,0,0,0                 ;reserved
.db     0,0,0,0                 ;reserved
.db     0,0,0,0                 ;reserved
.db     0,0,0,0                 ;user defined
.db     255,255,255,255         ;length and checksum (255=unused)
.db     "Command Name",0        ;max 31 characters, plus the zero
.org    locat+64                ;executable code begins here
</pre>

In this example, the command will be executed when the user presses
the 'A' key.  The specified character must be uppercase, because
PAULMON2 calls the
<a href="functions.html#upper">upper</a> function to make the user
interface case insensitive.
