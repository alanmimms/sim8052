Two programs are required to run on your PC to use PAULMON.

<h3>Terminal Emulation</h3>

<a name="terminal">
A terminal emulation program is required to communicate with your
8051 based hardware which is running PAULMON.  Though nearly any
terminal emulation program should work, the following programs
have been reported to work:
<ul>
<li>ProComm (MSDOS)
<li>Seyon (X11, Linux)
<li>Terminal (Windows 3.1)
<li>HyperTerminal (Windows 95) - note: new settings may not take effect
	until you quit and restart.
</ul>
The data format is 8 bits, no parity, 1 stop bit, <b>no flow control</b>.
If you have a copy of PAULMON which is configured for a particular
baud rate and crystal, then you must use that baud rate.  Otherwise
PAULMON will attempt to detect the baud rate setting of your terminal
emulator program at start-up when you press Enter (ASCII code 13 is
expected).  Of course, only baud rates which the 8051 can produce
with your cyrstal can be detected... it's best to try a slow baud
rate first (300 or 1200) and try faster baud rates each time you
restart (power off, not just a reset).
<p>
Some terminal emulation programs may send data when they are started,
which can confuse the automatic baud rate detection in PAULMON.  It
is best to plug the 8051 board into the PC (with its power off), run
the terminal emulation program, and then apply power to the board
and press Enter.
<p>
Nearly all of the PAULMON features do not actually require emulation
of any particular terminal.  The memory editor in the extras package
is an exception, which requires VT100 terminal emulation to work.  If
VT100 terminal emulation isn't working, the other features will not
be affected.
<p>



<h3>Assembler</h3>

<a name="assembler">
An assembler is not strictly required to use PAULMON, but without
the assembler it is very difficult to write code which
can be downloaded to the 8051 based hardware via the
<a href="commands.html#d">Download Command</a>.
<p>
Nearly any 8051 assembler which produces
<a href="intel-hex.html">Intel-Hex</a>
output will
work, though many 8051 assemblers have slightly different input
syntax.  PAULMON2 is written using the AS31 assembler, which is
available for free.
