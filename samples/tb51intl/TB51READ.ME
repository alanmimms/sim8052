   This little gem is an 8051 BASIC interpreter that takes up only 3K and can 
run using only the internal memory of the 8051.  I obtained it from the INTEL
Insite library (bulletin board: (503) 681-0956), and cleaned it up a little.
The version from Intel had a .HEX file from an earlier release of the program,
and came without documentation. I generated .BIN and .HEX files for the current
version, and typed in the photo-copied documentation Intel mailed me, making a
few corrections as I went along (unfortunately including two new entries to 
the errata section!).

   I would appreciate hearing from anyone who fixes the bugs mentioned in the
errata section, or who ports the code to one of the common shareware 8051 
assemblers (TASM, Metalink, PseudoCode, etc.).  The code currently assembles
under Intel's ASM-51, and makes extensive use of that assembler's macro pro-
cessing capabilities.

   I would also like to hear from people who extend the interpreter in any way.
I have made some small changes (accessing the upper 128 bytes of internal mem-
ory on an 8052 being the most important), but since I have not been able to get
the code to assemble so far, I have made these changes by patching the .BIN
file in hex. I do not recommend this if you are interested in retaining
your sanity.ÿ

   Many thanks to Tom Lehman at Intel, who first posted TB51 on the Insite 
Library board after I nagged him, and then mailed me the documentation after I 
nagged him some more.  Even more thanks to JHW, the mysterious programmer known 
only by his initials, who created TB51.

Good luck!
